                    For the first post of this blog I think I should talk about one of my all time favorites and 
                longest playing game till this day, is League of Legends! Possibly one of the best team strategy game
                there is right now. League has been around for over a decade now! It is a 5 vs 5 online multiplayer game where each 
                player can select from a variety of champions with different abilities to battle it out on a map with 3 lanes. 
                The objective of this game is to destroy your enemies base or my preferred method, make them surrender.
                </p>

                    The reason I like this game so much is because it is skilled based and you can never get bored of playing it. 
                    Over time as games came out with new concepts and playstyles this game has never felt outdated and continues 
                    to evolve with it. I have been playing around 4-5 years and my favorite champion is Brand because 
                    he is ranged and a mage that does unbelievable damage!
