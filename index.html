                        After learning about generic tags and selectors, we were taught how to incorporate images into our code. Using the img src
                        and linking relative or absolute images. As well as linking a stylesheet or folder to our index. Having a relative
                        file is always more useful in the long run because it is a file that you have and can always maintain while having 
                        an absolute file could potentially ruin your website if that link is taken down.

                        Today in class we started diving into the language of HTML and CSS and how they are both used to create websites.
                        We learned what the p tag, anchor tags, and how to start a visual studio code project. Can't wait to dive 
                        deeper into HTML and learn how create websites!

                        For as long as I can remember, technology has always been a part of my life. 
                        Thing's as small as an MP3 player, to desktops, cars, etc. A piece of technology
                        that really sparked my interest in Computer Science is Gaming Consoles and Desktops. 
                        I have spent a lot of time playing video games and using the web
                        so it has influenced me to want to understand it more,
                        about how it gets programmed, and designed. I would like to design
                        a website, create an applciation, make a video game, or create a program.
                        So I potentially see myself pursuing a career as a: web developer, software 
                        engineer, or mobile application developer. But if another opportunity
                        comes along that will give me experience and knowledge in the field then
                        I would be happy to accept.
