        <p>
            For as long as I can remember, technology has always been a part of my life. 
            Thing's as small as an MP3 player, to desktops, cars, etc. A piece of technology
            that really sparked my interest in Computer Science is Gaming Consoles and Desktops. 
            I have spent a lot of time playing video games and using the web
            so it has influenced me to want to understand it more,
            about how it gets programmed, and designed. I would like to design
            a website, create an applciation, make a video game, or create a program.
            So I potentially see myself pursuing a career as a: web developer, software 
            engineer, or mobile application developer. But if another opportunity
            comes along that will give me experience and knowledge in the field then
            I would be happy to accept.
