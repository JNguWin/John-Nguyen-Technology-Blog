                I decided to make a website dedicated to storing information about C# while I am studying that language. 
                What's a better way of taking notes and making study guides than creating a whole website dedicated to doing that! 
                Check out my <a class = "post" href = "CSharp.html" >C# Blog</a> to hear me talk about the language and things I find most important to know!

                Aside from learning computer programming another activity I enjoy doing that involves computers is playing
                video games! If you are a gamer too and want to see relatable gamer posts and games I am playing then come

                After learning about generic tags and selectors, we were taught how to incorporate images into our code. 
                Using the img src and linking relative or absolute images. As well as linking a stylesheet or folder to our index. 
                Having a relative file is always more useful in the long run because it is a file that you have and can always 
                maintain while having an absolute file could potentially ruin your website if that link is taken down.

                Today in class we started diving into the language of HTML and CSS and how they are both used to create websites.
                We learned what the p tag, anchor tags, and how to start a visual studio code project. Can't wait to dive 
                deeper into HTML and learn how create websites!

                For as long as I can remember, technology has always been a part of my life. 
                Thing's as small as an MP3 player, to desktops, cars, etc. A piece of technology
                that really sparked my interest in Computer Science is Gaming Consoles and Desktops. 
                I have spent a lot of time playing video games and using the web
                so it has influenced me to want to understand it more,
                about how it gets programmed, and designed. I would like to design
                a website, create an applciation, make a video game, or create a program.
                So I potentially see myself pursuing a career as a: web developer, software 
                engineer, or mobile application developer. But if another opportunity
                comes along that will give me experience and knowledge in the field then
                I would be happy to accept.
