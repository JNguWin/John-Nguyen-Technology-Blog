                <ul>
                    <li>In our programming 3 class we are learning object oriented programming (OOP). 
                        We are currently learning about inheritance and the reason why inheritance is so important is 
                        because it is one of the four pillars in programming. The four pillars are 
                        <em><b>Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.</b></em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The reason why inheritance is so important is because it stores data in one class that can be passed to 
                        another class. It also allows us to reuse a lot of codes and organizes fields a lot better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When creating different classes remember to always remember to set your: fields, constructor, and properties!
                        In your class program remember to include the code for inheritance which is the semicolon between the
                        two classes if it is going to be the child class. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <p>public class Class B : Class A</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Another thing to keep in mind is in your constructor you also need to include base and all the 
                        attributes from the inherited class in parentheses and the datatype and attribute name in 
                        method constructor followed by any new attributes added from this class.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <p>public class Class B : Class A</p>
                <p>public Class B(string firstName, string lastName, int managerID) 
                    : base(firstName, lastName)</p>
